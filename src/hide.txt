[ifdef] DEPRECATED

*** Note this is all superseded by the \"locals\" support ***





\\ Once the ForthOS system is entirely built and you're ready to
\\ focus on your own coding, there are a terrible lot of words sitting
\\ around in \"forth\" which are of no interest to the developer; internal
\\ words, user variables, and so forth.  The screens which follow
\\ provide the ability to pick some vocabulary, and then let you name
\\ words which will be plucked from their current vocabulary and moved
\\ over to the new one.

\\ There are also screens beyond that which use this facility do a
\\ cleanup of \"forth\", putting most of the internal words into a new
\\ \"sys\" vocabulary, and putting all user variables into \"usr\".
