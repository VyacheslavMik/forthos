Remember bits of allocated memory which we should free \"later on\"

: ephem Record this bit of memory as ephemeral

: (cleanEphem) Iterator to free out each queued part
: cleanEphem We're \"all done\", so flush out any accumulated bits of
 temporarily allocated memory

Mark object storage ephemeral; subclasses will flag storage under their
 instance variables as needed (and then super-> to get this)
