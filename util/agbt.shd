AgBtree is an AgView of Btree's























:method @ Return value for this key from whichever B-tree first has it
























:method do Iterate across all values in the B-tree.  If a value is at
 a given key in more than one layer, only the outermost one is seen
 by the iterator function.
TBD: if this goes too slow, may need to maintain parallel indices
 into the constituent B-trees rather than iteratively re-indexing
 into each of them to find successive steps.
